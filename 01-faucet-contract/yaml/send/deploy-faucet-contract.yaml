# This YAML file describes a transaction that, when executed, will deploy the
# faucet contract to Chainweb.
#
# To execute this request (you must have funded the faucet account):
# faucet-request --send deploy-faucet-contract --signers goliath-faucet
#
# Alternately, to fund the faucet account _and_ deploy the contract:
# faucet-deploy

networkId: "development"
type: "exec"

# To deploy our contract we need to send its entire contents to Chainweb as a
# transaction. When a Chainweb node receives a module it will attempt to
# register it in the given namespace.
codeFile: "../../faucet.pact"

# The 'data' key is for JSON data we want to include with our transaction. As a
# general rule, any use of (read-msg), (read-keyset), and so on in your contract
# indicates data that must be included here.
#
# Our contract reads the transaction data twice:
#   - (read-keyset "goliath-faucet-keyset")
#   - (read-msg "init")
data:
  goliath-faucet-keyset:
    # On deployment, our contract will register a new keyset reference on
    # Chainweb named "goliath-faucet-keyset". The keyset at this reference will
    # govern the goliath-faucet module, which means the module can only be
    # upgraded by this keyset.
    #
    # We want our faucet account to control the module, so we'll reuse the
    # keyset that guards our faucet account, ie. the goliath-faucet.yaml keys.

    pred: "keys-all"

  # Next, our contract looks for an 'init' key to determine whether it should
  # initialize data (for example, whether it should create tables). This request
  # deploys the contract, so we'll set this to true.
  init: true

signers:
  # The contract verifies that the keyset that governs the goliath-faucet module
  # is satisfied by the transaction signatures. Since the goliath-faucet module
  # is governed by the goliath-faucet account, we need that account to sign this
  # transaction.

  # The faucet contract only works on chain 0, so that's where we'll deploy it.

  # The contract should be deployed by the faucet account, which means the
  # faucet account is responsible for paying the gas for this transaction. You
  # must have used the 'fund-faucet-account.yaml' request to fund the faucet
  # account before you can use this deployment request file.
  sender: "goliath-faucet"

  # To determine the gas limit for most requests you can simply execute the Pact
  # code in the REPL, use (env-gaslog) to measure consumption, and round up the
  # result. However, deployment is different; you can't simply measure a call to
  # (load "faucet.pact") as it will provide an inaccurate measure.
  #
  # Instead, I first set the gas limit to 150000 (the maximum) and deployed the
  # contract to our local simulation Chainweb. Then, I recorded the gas
  # consumption that the node reported and round it up.
  gasLimit: 150000
