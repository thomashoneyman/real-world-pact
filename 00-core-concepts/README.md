# Core Concepts

The Core Concepts series is an introduction to building decentralized applications in the Kadena ecosystem using the Pact programming language. It's a companion to the projects in Real World Pact and should be read first. The series has three articles:

1. [Introduction to Blockchain Development with Kadena](./01-Introduction.md)
2. [Learn Pact in 20 Minutes](./02-Pact-In-20-Minutes.md)
3. Testing and Formal Verification in the Pact REPL (Publishing on **May 4**)

The Real World Pact repository demonstrates these concepts through several real-world projects building from a simple faucet contract to a full-featured lending app with formal verification and an accompanying whitepaper.
